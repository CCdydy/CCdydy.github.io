abstract: in a multiplicity of fields of representation and fusion of information. However, in complex evidence theory, conflict measurement is still an open issue. To address this problem, we propose a new complex belief 𝜒2 divergence measure (𝐶𝐵𝜒2), which has the ability to measure the discrepancy between the complex basic belief assignments (CBBAs). In addition, the proposed 𝐶𝐵𝜒2 divergence measure satisfies the properties of nonnegativity, nondegeneracy and symmetry. Particularly, when the CBBA degenerates to classical basic belief assignments (BBA), the proposed divergence can also measure the conflict well. On this basis, a novel 𝐵𝐸𝑜𝐶𝐵𝜒2𝐷 is proposed to measure the complexity of cardiac interbeat interval time series in biological system. An application in cardiac interbeat interval time series analysis demonstrates that 𝐵𝐸𝑜𝐶𝐵𝜒2𝐷 has better accuracy.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  In this paper we only consider cardiac interbeat interval time series analysis from the perspective of complexity. Therefore, in future works, we will address the problem of algorithm complexity by integrating the technique of quantum information processing. Besides, we would like to combine the 𝐵𝐸𝑜𝐶𝐵𝜒2D.
