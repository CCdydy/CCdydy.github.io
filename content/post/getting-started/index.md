## Overview

Hello everyone,
I am honored to announce that I have successfully joined the laboratory led by Professor Xiao Fuyuan of Chongqing University, welcoming a new academic journey. Here, I am fortunate to explore cutting-edge research in fields such as information fusion, intelligent information processing, modeling and decision-making of uncertain information, and quantum information processing with a senior professor and an outstanding research team.

Mentor Introduction:

Professor Xiao Fuyuan, a doctoral supervisor at Chongqing University, is honored with the title of "Hongshen Youth Scholar" and has been listed as one of Chongqing's outstanding young talents. His research areas cover a wide range, mainly focusing on information fusion, intelligent information processing, modeling and decision-making of uncertain information, quantum information processing, and other aspects. As the first and corresponding author, his research findings have been published in important publications such as IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TCYB, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TSMCS, IEEE TFS, etc. At the same time, the professor also holds important positions such as National Natural Science Foundation communication evaluation expert and Ministry of Education Degree Center degree thesis communication evaluation expert.
